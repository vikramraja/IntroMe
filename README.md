IntroMe
=======

facilitates 1-1 communication in large communities

Idea came from a basic human version  I implemented for the HackCon FB group. Could be interesting not only for HackCon to keep using,but for other communities of like minded people where intros are not always easy.

Stage one: phone number mapping between users

Stage two: Facebook API to pair people to people they have not likely met before.
